This project shows how we can use ArcFace loss (A better lose) with CNNs to predict the data better.
This project is built on CIFAR10 dataset but I have also enabled the option to select MNIST dataset if you need. 
The ArcFace Loss is calculated using the formula and ArcNet is a netework formed to implement using that loss function.
The images 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg shows the result of classification task after respective epoch.

I have also shared the paper for reference.
