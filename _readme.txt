This project shows how we can use ArcFace loss (A better lose) with CNNs to predict the data better.
This project is built on CIFAR10 dataset but I have also enabled the option to select MNIST dataset if you need. 
The ArcFace Loss is calculated using the formula and ArcNet is a netework formed to implement using that loss function.
